🎥 SmartLead Enricher – Video Walkthrough Script

Hi, I’m Likhitha Bhagyasri Yella, and this is my submission for the Caprae AI-Readiness Challenge.

The project is called SmartLead Enricher, and it’s designed to enhance B2B lead generation by transforming raw company names into enriched, structured, outreach-ready lead data.

🔍 Problem Statement:
Traditional tools like SaaSquatchLeads rely mainly on scraping data. They provide large amounts of raw data, but it's unstructured and not immediately usable.

💡 My Solution:
I focused on one impactful enhancement — building an enrichment layer that simulates and structures leads intelligently.

When a user enters a company name, my tool does three things:

Generates a likely professional email address using common naming patterns and the domain.

Predicts and formats the correct company domain for outreach.

Estimates the LinkedIn profile link for that company.

The final output is a clean, API-ready JSON format that can easily plug into a CRM or automation tool.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python (Flask) for the backend

HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend

All enrichment is simulated
